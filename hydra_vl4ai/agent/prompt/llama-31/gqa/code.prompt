Provided Python Functions/Class:

class ImagePatch:
    '''
    A Python class containing a crop of an image centered around a particular object, as well as relevant information.
    Attributes

    cropped_image : array_like
        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left, lower, right, upper : int
        An int describing the position of the (left/lower/right/upper) border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    
    Methods
    -------
    find(object_list: list[str]) -> dict[str, list[ImagePatch]]
        Returns a dictionary. Each pair includes a list of ImagePatch objects matching the object_name contained in the crop, if any are found.

        Returns True if the object possesses the visual property, and False otherwise.
    simple_query(question: str, qa_mode: bool = True) -> str
        Gnerate caption of image or get the answer to a basic question asked about the image. If no question is provided, returns the answer to "What is this?".
    best_text_match(option_list: List[str]) -> str
        Returns the string that best matches the image.
    crop(left: int, lower: int, right: int, upper: int, image_name: str) -> ImagePatch
        Returns a new ImagePatch object containing a crop of the image at the given coordinates.

        '''
        Returns a dictionary. Each pair includes a list of ImagePatch objects matching the object_name contained in the crop, if any are found.
